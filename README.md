        c.customer_name,
        c.customer_segment,
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price * (1 - oi.discount_percent/100)) AS order_revenue
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.customer_segment, o.order_id, o.order_date
),
customer_clv AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        customer_name,
        customer_segment,

        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(o.order_date, cc.cohort_month)) * 12 + 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(o.order_date, cc.cohort_month)) AS months_since_cohort
    FROM customer_cohorts cc
    JOIN orders o ON cc.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_status = 'Completed'
),
cohort_sizes AS (
    SELECT 
        cohort_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cohort_size
    FROM customer_cohorts
    GROUP BY cohort_month
),
retention_data AS (
    SELECT 
        ca.cohort_month,
        ca.months_since_cohort,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ca.customer_id) AS active_customers,
        cs.cohort_size
    FROM customer_activities ca
    JOIN cohort_sizes cs ON ca.cohort_month = cs.cohort_month

    GROUPING(p.category) AS category_grouping,
    GROUPING(c.country) AS country_grouping,
    GROUPING(TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM')) AS month_grouping
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY CUBE(p.category, c.country, TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM'))
ORDER BY 
    GROUPING(p.category), 
    GROUPING(c.country), 
    GROUPING(TO_CHAR(o.order_date, 'YYYY-MM')),
    category,
    country,
    order_month;
```

### Key Insights:
- Single query generates all possible aggregation combinations
- Provides grand totals, subtotals by category, country, and month
- Eliminates need for multiple separate queries

## Challenges Encountered:

### Challenge 1: Handling Date Arithmetic for Cohort Analysis
Issue: Calculating months between dates accurately, especially when dealing with month-end edge cases.
Solution: Used PostgreSQL's AGE() function combined with EXTRACT() to calculate exact month differences:

```bash
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(o.order_date, cc.cohort_month)) * 12 + 
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(o.order_date, cc.cohort_month)) AS months_since_cohort
```


### Challenge 2: Performance Optimization with Large Datasets
Issue: Window functions can be computationally expensive, especially with multiple partitions.
Solution:

Created strategic composite indexes on frequently joined columns
Used CTEs to break complex queries into manageable chunks
Leveraged ROWS BETWEEN instead of RANGE BETWEEN for better performance

```bash
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date_status ON orders(customer_id, order_date, order_status);
```

### Challenge 3: RFM Scoring Logic
Issue: Determining appropriate thresholds for customer segmentation that work across different business scales.
Solution: Used NTILE(5) to create dynamic quintile-based scoring that automatically adjusts to the data distribution, rather than hard-coded thresholds.

### Challenge 4: Handling NULL Values in Moving Averages
Issue: Early dates in the dataset don't have enough preceding rows for full moving average windows.
Solution: Used ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW which gracefully handles edge cases by using available rows only.

## Conclusion:
